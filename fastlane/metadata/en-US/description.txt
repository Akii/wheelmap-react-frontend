The Wheelmap iPhone App is the mobile app for Wheelmap.org, an open, free and global online map for wheelchair-accessible places provided by Sozialhelden e.V. 

With the app, all iPhone and iPod touch users can find, mark and add accessible and less accessible public places on a virtual map. Users can also upload photos and add comments to places. 
With the provided information mobility-impaired people can easily find out which underground stations, restaurants, cafes or clubs around them are accessible and which are not. This increases their mobility and participation in society, creating more public awareness for their needs and rights. 

Everyone can get engaged and help by marking the wheelchair accessibility of public places with the easy traffic light system.

Wheelmap is based on OpenStreetMap and works similar to Wikipedia - everyone can contribute to improving the accumulated data. The app draws its information directly from the net. All data is always up to date.

- To search for places and to mark the accessibility status of an existing place, no registration is required.
